# Graph Algorithms
Graph algorithms studied in the Graph Theory and Application (TAG - Teoria e Aplicação de Grafos) class at Universidade de Brasília (UnB) in the first semester of 2021.

## Available Algorithms

The notebooks are divided in two parts: "e1", where you can find more basic algorithms and applications of Graph Theory; and "e2", with more advanced algorithms and applications.

The algorithms are applied to graphs modeled as adcjacency lists - in most cases using sets with dicts.

You can see the list below of what is available in this repository:

### E1 Algorithms
 <ul>
  <li>Undirected Graph as Abstract Data Type (ADT)</li>
  <li>Depth First Search (DFS)</li>
  <li>Bron-Kerbosch Algorithm</li>
  <li>Local Clustering Coefficient and Average Clustering Coefficient</li>
  <li>Kahn Algorithm</li>
  <li>Kosaraju-Sharir Algorithm</li>
  <li>Topological Order (using DFS)</li>
</ul>

### E2 Algorithms
 <ul>
  <li>Breadth First Search (BFS)</li>
  <li>Bipartite Graph Detection</li>
  <li>Find Maximum Matching</li>
  <li>Find Minimum Cover Vertex</li>
  <li>Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm</li>
  <li>Gale-Shapley Algorithm (applied to hospitals and couples)</li>
  <li>Greedy Coloring Graph Algorithm</li>
  <li>Prim Algorithm</li>
</ul>
